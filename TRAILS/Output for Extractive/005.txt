The idea, says BT, is to shape a "21st Century model" which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together."We are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology," said Frank Stone, head of the BT's business sector programmes."The river was integral to the city's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared," said the artists.BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners.The art world is "fantastically rich", said Mr Stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like BT want to get in with them.
