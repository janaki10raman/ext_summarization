Virus poses as Christmas e-mail

Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail.Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.The virus' subject line says "Merry Christmas" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to.
